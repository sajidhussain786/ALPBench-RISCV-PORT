*********************** PREPROCESSING ***********************

coords.3368:  This file contains image names and eyecoordintates for many 
    frontal images in the FERET database. It includes five images that 
    were added to the list later. There use to be more images with eye 
    coordinates. Many of these images were computer generated alterations 
    of other database images. For example, the images scaled to a different 
    size, or the color of the shirts were inverted.  For this reason the 
    images are not acceptable for general experiments on face recogntion 
    algorithms.  To reduce confusion the artifically genereated images 
    were elimanated.  If an image is not within this set its validity 
    should be questioned.

*********************** TRAINING ***********************
The following files are used for the training phase of the algorithms.

feret_training.srt: standard file used for training PCA, LDA, and BIC.

feret_training_x2.srt: This file contains a subset of the previous file 
    that has two images per subject

ebgm70.srt: This file contains the names of seventy images and corresponding
    landmark location files that are used to create the bunch graph for the 
    EBGM algorithm.

trainingcd.srt This is an alternative training file. This file contains 
    images from the FERET database that were contained on the training 
    CD.  All these images are fair game for training for the FERET test.

*********************** TESTING ***********************
all.srt: This list contians all of the images with eye coordinates.  
    Durring typical operation, each algorithm generates a distance 
    matrix for every image in this set.  Individual tests can run on 
    the distance matrix to determine the performance on other tests 
    such as fb, fc, dup1, dup2, or permute.

all.hi.srt all.lo.srt: This is the all.srt file split into two parts.  
    It is used on duel processor machines by processing half of the 
    full image list at one time.

*********************** EXPERIMENTS ***********************
The following files are the four probesets and the gallery(fa) used in 
the FERET Test.  These files are used to create rank curves.
dup1.srt
dup2.srt
fafb.srt
fafc.srt
feret_gallery.srt

list640.srt: This file is used for the permutaion test. This list is 
    of 160 subjects with four images each.

imagecovariates.cov: This contains many differnt statistics for the 
    pixel values in the FERET images. 

facecovariates.cov: This file contains the covariate data about a 
    subset of the feret database, such as, gender, race, glasses, etc.

facecovariates.srt: This is a file containing all of the images in the 
    face covaritates file.



*********************** MISC ***********************

ebgm150.srt: This file is a list of all images that have manually selected 
    landmark points. ebgm70.srt is a randomly selected subset of this list. 
    
feret_all.srt
largetrain.srt
list1024.srt
list1024_all_subset.srt
list1024_subset.srt
list2144.srt

*********************** SCRAPS ***********************
The following files are used with the CSU scrap shot database.  The database 
is a small set of images taken from pre 1925 CSU year books.  These images 
are of low quality and should not be used for any experments.  

coords.scraps
scrap_all.srt
scrap_all_x4.srt
scrap_gallery.srt
