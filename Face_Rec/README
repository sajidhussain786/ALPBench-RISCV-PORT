csuFaceIdEval README
--------------------

For detailed information on the algorithms please consult the
"The CSU Face Identification Evaluation System User's Guide:
Verions 5.0"

Compiling the system
--------------------

Once unpacking the distribution change into the distribution
directory and type "make"

    # cd csuEvalFaceRec
    # scripts/runAllTests_feret.sh


II. Using the provided scripts
==============================

The provided scripts come in two different versions. The "feret"
versions execute tests on a standard FERET image set (not provided)
while the "scraps" versions execute tests on the much smaller 
"csuScrapShots" image set which is provided with this distribution
for testing purposes.

The PGM files for the "csuScrapShots" image set are provided under
"data/csuScrapShots/source/pgm". Those for the FERET image set are
not provided. For the "feret" scripts to work, it is assumed that
the PGM files for the standard FERET sets are copied into the
"data/FERET/source/pgm" directory.

------------------------------
SCRIPTS FOR TESTING THE SYSTEM
------------------------------

These two scripts allow you to test the system by running
the normalization code and all the experiments (PCA, LDA
and Bayesian) sequentially:

   runAllTests_feret.sh
   runAllTests_scraps.sh

These scripts ought to be executed from the "csuEvalFaceRec"
directory:

    # cd csuEvalFaceRec
    # scripts/runAllTests_feret.sh

Or:

    # cd csuEvalFaceRec
    # scripts/runAllTests_scraps.sh

In general, after installing the system and compiling the
files, you should at least run "runAllTests_scraps.sh"
to make sure the system is operating correctly.

---------------------
NORMALIZATION SCRIPTS
---------------------

The following two scripts execute the process to convert
the source PGM files into the normalized the images that
are needed to perform the experiments:

   scripts/runPreprocessing_feret.sh
   scripts/runPreprocessing_scraps.sh

These scripts only need to be executed once. Normalized
images will be stored in "data/FERET/normSep2002*" directories
and "data/csuScrapShots/normSep2002*" directories.

------------------
EXPERIMENT SCRIPTS
------------------

The following scripts run the individual expriments:

   scripts/runBayesian_feret.sh
   scripts/runBayesian_scraps.sh

   scripts/runLDA_feret.sh
   scripts/runLDA_scraps.sh

   scripts/runPCA_feret.sh
   scripts/runPCA_scraps.sh

One script is provided for each variation on the face identification
algorithm (PCA, LDA and Bayesian) as well as for the two data sets.

Running these experiments will generate distance information in the
"distances" directory.

-----------------------------------
SCRIPTS FOR GENERATING A RANK CURVE
-----------------------------------

This script generates recognition rank curves for the FERET experiment
for the fafb, fafc, dup1 and dup2 probe sets:

   scripts/makeRankCurves_feret.sh

These rank curves are saved as text files in the "results" directory.
