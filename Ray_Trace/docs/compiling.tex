\section{Compiling \RAY\ From Source Code}
\index{compiling on Unix systems}
  In order to use \RAY\, you may need to compile it from source 
code, since it is normally distributed in source code form.
Building \RAY\ binaries is a fairly straightforward process.  
Download the \RAY\ distribution from the web/ftp server.  Once you 
have downloaded the distribution, unpack the distribution using 
gunzip and tar.  Once the distribution is unpacked, cd into the 
'tachyon' directory, and then into the 'unix' directory.  
Once in the 'unix' directory, type 'make' to see the list of 
configurations that are currently supported.  

\begin{verbatim}
johns:/disk5/users/johns/graphics % gunzip tachyon.tar.gz
johns:/disk5/users/johns/graphics % tar -xvf tachyon.tar.gz
johns:/disk5/users/johns/graphics % cd tachyon
johns:/disk5/users/johns/graphics/tachyon % cd unix
johns:/disk5/users/johns/graphics/tachyon/unix % make
  Choose one of the architectures specified below.

Type: 'make arch' to build for an architecture listed above.

johns:/disk5/users/johns/graphics/ray/unix % make solaris-thr

[lots of make output ommitted]

  Hopefully once you've run 'make' to build the ray tracer for your machine,
everything went well and you now have a binary to run.  If you are building
an MPI version, you may need to edit the make-config file to edit the 
locations of libraries and header files as they are listed there.
If you have trouble, for now the best way to go is to send me email, at
{\em \EMAIL}  As I have time I'll improve this document and give
more detailed instructions on building.
